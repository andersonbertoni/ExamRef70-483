         * creates the text of a warning letter to the customer telling them that their account is
         * overdraw. This will have to be different for each type of account (you don't want to use

         * programmers overriding this witha  more specific message, but you then have no way of making
         * sure that they really do perform the override. C# provides a way of flagging a method as 
         * abstract. This means that the method body is not provided in this class, but will be provided
         * in a child class.
         * The fact that the BankAccount4 class contains an abstract method means that the class itself
         * is abstract (and must be marked as such). It is not possible to make an instance of an 
         * abstract class. If you think about it this is sensible. An instance of BankAccount4  would
         * not know what to do if the WarningLetterString method was ever called.
         * An abstract class can be tought of as a kind of template. If you want to make an instance 
         * of a class based on an abstract parent you must provide implementations of all the abstract
         * methods given in the parent.
         * Abstract classes are different from interfaces in that they can contain fully implemented
